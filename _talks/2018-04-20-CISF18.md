This talk has been held during the parallel sessions of the [4th Italian Conference of Physics Students](http://ai-sf.it/cisf18/).

In the first part of this talk I have illustrated two of the main problems of theoretical ecology: [May's stability criterion](https://www.nature.com/articles/238413a0) and the [competitive exclusion principle](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/131/3409/1292). I have then shown the main results of my thesis, which concern a [model](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.028103) that describes resource-consumer interactions inspired by microbial systems.
