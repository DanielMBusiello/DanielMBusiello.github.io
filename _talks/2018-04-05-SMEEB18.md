This talk has been held during the conference [Stochastic Models in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://www.pd.infn.it/~maritan/veniceworkshop/veniceworkshop.html).

After a brief introduction on two of the most important problems in theoretical ecology ([May's stability criterion](https://www.nature.com/articles/238413a0) and the [competitive exclusion principle](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/131/3409/1292)) in this talk I have illustrated the latest results of my research work, including my Master's thesis and all the findings I have made from the beginning of my PhD.
