I'm Daniel Maria Busiello, currently a Post-doc at University of Padua. I work in the [LiPh lab](http://www.pd.infn.it/~maritan/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan. My research interests involve stochastic thermodynamics, non-equilibrium systems, entropy production, pattern formation and population dynamics.
